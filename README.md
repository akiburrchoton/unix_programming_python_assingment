# Unix Programming in Python

<h5>Project Overview:</h5>
The “Unix Programming in Python” repository showcases assignments focused on leveraging Python to emulate Unix-like programming tasks. This project emphasizes the integration of Unix system programming principles with Python scripting, providing a practical approach to handling system-level operations.

<h5>Technical Features and Implementations:</h5>
<h6>File Manipulation:<h6>
<ul>
<li>File Handling: Developed Python scripts for various file operations including reading from, writing to, and modifying files. </li>
<li>Directory Operations: Implemented utilities to manage directories, such as listing directory contents, creating and deleting  directories.</li>
</ul>
Process Control:
• Process Management: Created scripts to manage processes, including starting, monitoring, and terminating processes. The scripts mimic Unix process control behaviors.
• Signal Handling: Incorporated functionality for signal handling to manage Unix signals, allowing scripts.

Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
• IPC Mechanisms: Employed Python’s built-in libraries to implement IPC. This includes the use of pipes and other IPC techniques.
• CLI Design: Designed command-line interfaces for interacting with the scripts, allowing users to execute various tasks. This approach mirrors Unix command-line tools, providing a familiar interface for users.

Key Scripts:
• file_operations.py: Implements basic file operations, such as reading from and writing to files.
• process_management.py: Handles process creation, monitoring, and termination.
• ipc_communication.py: Demonstrates inter-process communication using pipes and other methods.

Technical Approach:
Utilized Python scripting to implement Unix functionalities, Python’s libraries and modules for system-level programming tasks. The project focuses on practical applications and problem-solving in a Unix-like environment using Python.
